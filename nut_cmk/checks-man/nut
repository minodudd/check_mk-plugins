description:
 Describe here: This check monitors health statistics like error counters of UPS units using the
  information reported by nut. it generates a number of checks similar to the SMART
  plugin.

  The check uses information provided by the Check_MK linux agent which are
  available when the agent has been extended with the {nut} agent plugin.

perfdata:
 One variable for each of the known state counters.

inventory:
  If there is at least one supported value available for a UPS one service is
  inventorized.

[parameters]
 The warning/critical levels for each supported numeric values are parameterized.

 examples:

 # Set UPS Temperature warning/critical levels to 35°C and 40°C
 nut_temp_default_values = (35, 40)

 # Set UPS Load Percentage warning/critical levels to 50% and 70%
 nut_load_default_values = (50, 70)

 # Set UPS Output Voltage warning/critical levels to 245v and 250v
 nut_output_default_values = (245, 250)

 # Set UPS Battery Voltage warning/critical levels to 10v and 5v
 nut_battery_default_levels = (10, 5)

 # Set UPS Input Voltage Fault (wall outlet voltage fault) warning/critical levels to 155v and 160v
 nut_input_voltage_fault_default_levels = (155,  160)

 # Set UPS Input Voltage (wall outlet voltage ) warning/critical levels to 245v and 250v
 nut_input_default_levels = (245, 250)

 # Set UPS Input Frequency (wall outlet frequency) warning/critical levels to 51Hz and 55Hz
 nut_input_freq_default_levels = (51, 55)
